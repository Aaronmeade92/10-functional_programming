#### Single-line Summary
**Today, _ and _ paired together. It took about _**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1.
  <!-- // TODO: Wrap the contents of this file, except for the preceding 'use strict' and 'var app...' declararions, in an IIFE.
  // Give the IIFE a parameter called 'module'.
  // At the very end of the code, but still inside the IIFE, attach the 'articleView' object to 'module'.
  // Where the IIFE is invoked, pass in the global 'app' object that is defined above.
  // Keep in mind that all references to 'Article' in this file now need to be renamed to 'app.Article'. There are not separate instructions for those; you'll need to debug and find them on your own. -->
  Wrapped contents of file in IIFE function, using module as a parameter.

  2.
  <!-- TODO: Call the Handlebars `.compile` function, which will return a function for you to use where needed.
  Make sure you assign the result of your Handlebars.compile call to a variable called "template", since we are then calling "template" on line 117. -->
